/**
\file Defines.h
\brief Global user-overridable defines.

This file defines, in one place, all the defines which can be defined in order
to override default options within Theron. Some of them enable or disable debugging
functionality, others abstract away platform-specific detail such as code inlining
and variable alignment, and still others control the operation of Theron such as
the limits on the number of threads per \ref Framework and the total number of \ref Actor
"Actors" and \ref Receiver "Receivers" that can be created in an application.

\note The intention is that most users will be able to leave these defines at their default
values, hardly knowing they're there. But if you do need to override one of them then
the best way to do it is to define the define globally in your build (for example as
a compiler option), rather than by editing this file. The definitions of the defines
in this file are all conditional on the define having not already been defined, so can
be easily overridden just by defining the defines yourself globally in your build.

the default value defined in the code. This is arranged this way on the assumption that

/**
\brief Controls force-inlining of core functions within Theron.

Many functions within Theron are force-inlined via compiler keywords, to avoid
function call overhead, resulting in a significant speedup over optionally inlined code.
The use of forced inlining does however lead to some code bloat. Therefore it may
be desirable to turn it off in some builds. Moreover, it makes debugging difficult when
enabled, so it is useful to be able to disable it, and desirable for it to be disabled,
by default, in debug builds.

\ref THERON_FORCEINLINE defines the keyword used for inlined function definitions.
It defaults to __forceinline for Visual C++, and inline __attribute__((always_inline))
for gcc, when \ref THERON_DEBUG is 0. Otherwise it defaults to the inline keyword, obligatory
on functions defined in headers.

in the build (in the makefile using -D, or in the project preprocessor settings
in Visual Studio).

#ifndef THERON_ENABLE_MESSAGE_REGISTRATION_CHECKS
/**
\brief Enables run-time reporting of unregistered message types, which is off by default.

Message types can be registered using the \ref THERON_REGISTER_MESSAGE macro, which notifies
Theron of the unique name of a message type. Registering the message types sent within an
application causes Theron's internal type ID system to be used to identity messages when they
arrive at an actor, instead of the built-in C++ typeid system.

This has two useful effects: Firstly, it avoids calling the slow C++ dynamic_cast
operator, and instead performs a simple check on the unique name associated with each message type
(a fast pointer comparison). Secondly, it allows the C++ compiler's built-in Run-Time Type
Information (RTTI) system to be disabled, which avoids storing compiler-generated type IDs in
classes.

However this efficiency comes with a catch: once we start registering message types, we
have to remember to consistently always register *every* message type used by the application.
If any of the message types are omitted, then errors may ensue (usually caught by asserts,
in debug builds).

To make this easier, define \ref THERON_ENABLE_MESSAGE_REGISTRATION_CHECKS as 1 in your local
build (ideally globally with a compiler option). This enables run-time error reports that
helpfully detect message types that haven't been registered.

Of course, you should only enable this checking if you are actually intending to register your
message types! If you don't care about the overheads of RTTI and dynamic_cast, then it's perfectly
fine (and a lot simpler) to just not register *any* message types at all -- and leave this define
disabled -- and then everything will work as normal.

\note Note that unregistered message types are reported by asserts, so are only active if assert
code is also enabled via \ref THERON_ENABLE_ASSERTS.

#ifndef THERON_ENABLE_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE_CHECKS
/**
\brief Enables reporting of undelivered and unhandled messages, which is enabled by default.

This define controls reporting of messages that are either not delivered (because no entity
exists at the address to which the message is sent, in which case \ref Theron::Actor::Send "Actor::Send"
and \ref Theron::Framework::Send "Framework::Send" return false), or not handled by the actor to
which they were delivered (because the actor has no message handlers registered for the message type
and no default message handler).

Such messages are passed to a \ref Theron::Framework::SetFallbackHandler "fallback handler"
registered with the \ref Theron::Framework "Framework" concerned (that within which the message was sent,
in the case of undelivered messages, and that containing the unresponsive actor, in the case of
unhandled messages). The default fallback handler registered with each framework, which is
used unless replaced explicitly by a custom user-specified fallback handler, reports such
messages to stderr using printf, and asserts, if asserts are enabled with \ref THERON_ENABLE_ASSERTS.

This define controls the activation of the default fallback handler. If defined to 1, the
default fallback handler reports failures. If defined to 0, it does nothing, and unhandled
messages are silently unreported. Defining \ref THERON_ENABLE_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE_CHECKS to 0
effectively turns off the checking. If the intention is to replace the reporting mechanism, then
use \ref Theron::Framework::SetFallbackHandler "SetFallbackHandler" to replace the default handler
entirely with a custom handler implementation.

Defaults to 1 (enabled). Set this to 0 to disable the reporting.

The value of \ref THERON_ENABLE_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE_CHECKS can be overridden by defining it
globally in the build (in the makefile using -D, or in the project preprocessor
settings in Visual Studio).

code; this is just a hard limit on the maximum number that can be set. Requests to create
larger numbers of threads are clamped to the value defined by this define.

By defining \ref THERON_CACHELINE_ALIGNMENT  globally within your own project build, you can
override the default value and specify a different size, either to optimize allocations for
a system with a different cache-line width, or else to disable cache-line alignment completely
by specifying a harmless alignment such as 4 bytes.
